The project focused on developing a machine learning model to detect similar question pairs by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and feature engineering
on the Quora dataset.The utilization of Random Forest and XGBoost models resulted in achieving high accuracy. Key skills demonstrated encompass data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying ML for text analysis, which underscore the significance of identifying similar question pairs.
Such identification is crucial for preventing duplicate content, enhancing user experience, enabling effective information retrieval, and improving recommendation systems, making it vital for various NLP applications.
